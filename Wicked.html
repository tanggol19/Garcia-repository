    <h2>Synopsis / Plot</h2>
    <p>In the Land of Oz, Glinda the Good joins the citizens of Munchkinland as they celebrate the death of the Wicked Witch of the West at the hands of "a Kansas child." When a child asks her why wickedness happens, Glinda ponders the question by discussing the Witch's backstory: born from an affair between the wife of then-Governor Thropp and a traveling salesman, she was ostracized from birth due to her unnaturally green skin and uncontrollable magical powers ("No One Mourns the Wicked"). When asked if she and the Witch were friends, Glinda reveals that they knew each other from school.</p>
